    "**Contrast generators and iterators in Python, outlining their key characteristics, usage scenarios, and performance implications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points to address in your response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definitions:** Provide clear definitions of generators and iterators in Python, highlighting their primary distinctions.\n",
    "- **Syntax:** Demonstrate how generators and iterators are defined and used syntactically.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** Explain how generators and iterators produce values and manage memory differently.\n",
    "- **Use cases:** Describe common scenarios where generators and iterators are particularly beneficial, such as:\n",
    "    - Processing large datasets without loading everything into memory at once\n",
    "    - Implementing custom iterable objects for custom data structures\n",
    "    - Creating infinite sequences (e.g., for simulating real-time data streams)\n",
    "    - Building lazy evaluation techniques for efficiency\n",
    "- **Performance implications:** Discuss the performance advantages and potential drawbacks of using generators and iterators in different contexts.\n",
    "- **Implementation nuances:** Explain the use of the `yield` keyword, the `iter()` function, and common iterator methods like `next()` and `__iter__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional challenges for advanced learners:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generator expressions:** Explore the syntax and usage of generator expressions for concise creation of generators.\n",
    "- **Custom iterators:** Demonstrate how to create custom iterator classes for tailored iteration behavior.\n",
    "- **Performance optimization techniques:** Discuss strategies for optimizing generator and iterator performance in specific use cases."
