# What is a Compiler?
A compiler is a program that translates a source language or high-level programming language (for example, Java, C++) into a target machine code (binary bits â€“ 1 and 0) that the CPU can process and understand. The program to be translated is written inside an editor and are known as source statements. The act of translating source code to machine or binary code is known as compilation.

During compilation, all the language statements will be parsed or analyzed to see if it is correct.
If there is no error, the compiler would then convert the source code into machine code which is then ready to execute.

The task of a compiler is generally divided into several phases. The phases include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, sematic analysis, intermediate code generator, code optimizer and code generator. Each of these phases helps convert the source code by breaking it down into tokens, generating parse trees and optimizing the source code.


# What is an Interpreter?
An interpreter is a program which also converts a high-level programming language  (like Python, PHP, Perl) into machine code. Although similar to a compiler, the way that code is executed is different for both. Unlike a compiler that simply converts the source code to machine code, an interpreter can be run directly as an executable program. Contrary to a compiler, it converts source code to machine code when the program is running and not before the program runs.
