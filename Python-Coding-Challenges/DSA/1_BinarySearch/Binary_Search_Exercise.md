**Binary Search Exercise**

1. When I try to find number 5 in the below list using binary search, it doesn't work and returns me a -1 index. Why is that?
   
`numbers = [1,4,6,9,10,5,7]`

3. Find the index of all the occurrences of a number from a sorted list
   
`numbers = [1,4,6,9,11,15,15,15,17,21,34,34,56] 
number_to_find = 15 `
