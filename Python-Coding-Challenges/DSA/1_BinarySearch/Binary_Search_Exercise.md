**Binary Search Exercise**

1. When I try to find number 5 in the below list using binary search, it doesn't work and returns me a -1 index. Why is that?
   `numbers = [1,4,6,9,10,5,7]`

3. Find the index of all the occurrences of a number from a sorted list
   ```python
   numbers = [1,4,6,9,11,15,15,15,17,21,34,34,56]
   number_to_find = 15
   ```

This should return 5,6,7 as indices containing the number 15 in the array
