## 🧠 What is **Insertion Sort**?

**Insertion Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array **one element at a time** — just like how you sort playing cards in your hand 🃏.

> 💡 **Think of it like this:**  
> Pick one card at a time from a pile, and insert it into its correct place among the sorted cards in your hand.

## 🎯 How It Works Step-by-Step

Let’s sort this array in **ascending order**:  
```
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
```

---

### ✅ Step 1: Start with the second element (`3`)
Compare it with `5`. Since `3 < 5`, insert `3` before `5`.

```
Before: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]  
        ^  ^
Sorted: [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Move to `8`
Compare with `5` → it's bigger → leave it in place.

```
Sorted: [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
               ↑
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Move to `4`
Compare with `8` → `4 < 8` → shift `8` right  
Compare with `5` → `4 < 5` → shift `5` right  
Compare with `3` → `4 > 3` → insert after `3`

```
Before: [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]  
After:  [3, 4, 5, 8, 2]
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Move to `2`
Compare with `8` → shift  
Compare with `5` → shift  
Compare with `4` → shift  
Compare with `3` → shift  
Nothing left → insert `2` at the beginning

```
Before: [3, 4, 5, 8, 2]  
After:  [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```

🎉 Done!

## 📊 Visualization Diagram

Each number is "inserted" into its correct place like so:

```
Original:       [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Pass 1:         [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]   ← Insert 3 before 5
Pass 2:         [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]   ← 8 stays
Pass 3:         [3, 4, 5, 8, 2]   ← Insert 4 between 3 and 5
Pass 4:         [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]   ← Insert 2 at the start
```

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

| Case        | Time     |
|-------------|----------|
| Best Case   | O(n)     ← (already sorted)  
| Worst Case  | O(n²)    ← (reversed list)  
| Space       | O(1)     ← in-place

## 🧠 Summary
- Good for small datasets.
- Great for **learning sorting logic**.
- Works like sorting cards in your hand!
