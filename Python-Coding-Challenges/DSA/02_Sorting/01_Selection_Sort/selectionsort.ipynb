    "# @Description: Selection Sort Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "# selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. \n",
    "# It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.\n",
    "# The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array:\n",
    "# 1) The subarray which is already sorted.\n",
    "# 2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.\n",
    "# In each iteration of selection sort, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.\n",
    "# This process continues until all elements are sorted.\n",
    "# Time Complexity: O(n^2) in all cases (best, average, worst)\n",
    "# Space Complexity: O(1) because it is an in-place sorting algorithm\n",
    "# It is not a stable sort, meaning that it may change the relative order of elements with equal keys.\n",
    "# It is not adaptive, meaning that it does not take advantage of existing order in the input data.\n",
    "# It is not a good choice for large datasets as it has a quadratic time complexity.\n",
    "# However, it is simple to implement and can be useful for small datasets or as part of more complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "def selection_sort(nums):\n",
    "    n = len(nums) # Get the length of the list\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        min_index = i # Assume the first element is the minimum\n",
    "        # Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part of the list\n",
    "        for j in range(i+1,n): # Start from the next element\n",
    "            # Compare the current element with the minimum element found so far\n",
    "            if nums[j] < nums[min_index]: # If the current element is smaller, update min_index\n",
    "                # Update min_index to the index of the new minimum element\n",
    "                min_index = j # Update min_index to the index of the new minimum element\n",
    "        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part\n",
