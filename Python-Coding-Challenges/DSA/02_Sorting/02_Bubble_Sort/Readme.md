## ðŸ§  **What is Bubble Sort?**

**Bubble Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works by **repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements** if they are in the wrong order. Itâ€™s called "bubble" sort because the biggest numbers **bubble up to the end** of the list with each pass.

---

## ðŸ‘£ **How It Works â€“ Step by Step**

Letâ€™s sort this list in **ascending order**:  
`[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`

We'll do **multiple passes** through the list. Each time, we compare two adjacent elements and **swap them if needed**.

---

### âœ… **Pass 1:**
Compare and swap if the left element is bigger than the right:

```
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]   â†’ Compare 5 and 3 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]   â†’ Compare 5 and 8 â†’ OK
[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]   â†’ Compare 8 and 4 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 4, 8, 2]
[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]   â†’ Compare 8 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
```

ðŸ‘‰ Biggest element `8` has **bubbled up** to the end.

---

### âœ… **Pass 2:**
```
[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]   â†’ Compare 3 and 5 â†’ OK
[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]   â†’ Compare 5 and 4 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 4, 5, 2, 8]
[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]   â†’ Compare 5 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]   â†’ Compare 5 and 8 â†’ OK
```

ðŸ‘‰ `5` is now in the correct position.

---

### âœ… **Pass 3:**
```
[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]   â†’ Compare 3 and 4 â†’ OK
[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]   â†’ Compare 4 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]   â†’ Compare 4 and 5 â†’ OK
```

ðŸ‘‰ `4` bubbles into place.

---

### âœ… **Pass 4:**
```
[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]   â†’ Compare 3 and 2 â†’ Swap â†’ [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```

ðŸ‘‰ Everything is now sorted! âœ…

## ðŸ“Š Visualization

Here's a **simple diagram** showing the bubbling of the largest elements to the end:

```
Original:        [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
After Pass 1:    [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]   â†’ 8 is in place
After Pass 2:    [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]   â†’ 5 is in place
After Pass 3:    [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]   â†’ 4 is in place
After Pass 4:    [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]   â†’ 3 and 2 are in place
```

## ðŸ§® Time Complexity
- Worst case: O(nÂ²)  
- Best case (already sorted): O(n) (if you optimize with a `swapped` flag)  
- Space complexity: O(1) â€“ it's an **in-place sort**

---

## âœ… Summary
- Compares **adjacent** elements
- **Swaps** if they're in the wrong order
- Repeats until no more swaps are needed
- Simple to understand, not efficient for large lists
