    "# Merge Sort Algorithm\n",
    "# Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.\n",
    "# It is a recursive algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts them and then merges them back together.\n",
    "# Merge sort is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output.\n",
    "# It is also an in-place sort, meaning that it does not require any additional storage space to perform the sorting.\n",
    "# Merge sort is a very efficient algorithm for large data sets, and it has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst case.\n",
    "# It is also a very good choice for sorting linked lists, as it does not require random access to the elements of the list.\n",
    "# Merge sort is not a good choice for small data sets, as it has a higher overhead than other sorting algorithms such as insertion sort or selection sort.\n",
