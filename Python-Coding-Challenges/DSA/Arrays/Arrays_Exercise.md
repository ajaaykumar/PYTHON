**Basic Understanding:**

1.  What is the key characteristic that makes arrays efficient for accessing elements?
2.  In Python, what built-in data structure is commonly used as a dynamic array?
3.  Explain the difference between a traditional static array and a dynamic array like a Python list.
4.  What is an index in the context of an array, and why is it important?
5.  If you have a Python list `my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, how would you access the element `30`?

**Array Operations:**

6.  Write a Python code snippet to add the element `50` to the end of the list `my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]`.
7.  Given the list `my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`, write code to insert the element `'orange'` at index 1.
8.  Write a Python code snippet to remove the element `20` from the list `my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]`.
9.  How would you check if the element `'banana'` exists in the list `my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` in Python?
10. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the index of the first occurrence of a given target number. If the target is not found, it should return -1.

**Multidimensional Arrays:**

11. How would you represent a 2x3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns) in Python using lists?
12. Write a Python code snippet to access the element in the second row and first column of the following 2D array: `matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.
13. Explain a scenario where you might use a 3D array in Python.
14. Write a Python function that takes a 2D array (list of lists) and prints each element in the array.

**Applications:**

15. Describe how you could use a Python list to store the daily temperatures for a week.
16. How could you represent a tic-tac-toe board using a 2D array (list of lists) in Python?
17. Explain how arrays are used in sorting algorithms like bubble sort. (You don't need to write the code, just the concept).
18. Describe a situation where using a dynamic array (like a Python list) would be more advantageous than using a static array.

**Advanced (Optional):**

19. What is the time complexity for accessing an element in a Python list by its index? Why?
20. What is the average time complexity for inserting an element at the end of a Python list? What happens when the list's underlying capacity is reached?
